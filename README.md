# Hypnotic Pattern Generator

Create mesmerizing kaleidoscopic patterns through simple mouse gestures with real-time symmetry transformations.

## Features
- **Mouse-driven patterns:** Drag to draw; patterns automatically apply symmetry transformations
- **Multiple symmetry modes:** Rotational, reflection, and spiral transformations
- **Speed-based complexity:** Faster movement = richer colors and denser patterns
- **Adjustable symmetry:** Change the fold count (2 to 16)
- **Real-time HUD:** See current mode, symmetry level, and mouse speed
- **Save patterns:** Capture beautiful designs as PNG images

## Controls
- **Drag mouse (left button):** Draw symmetrical patterns
- **SPACE:** Cycle through symmetry modes (rotational → reflection → spiral)
- **↑/↓ arrows:** Increase/decrease symmetry fold count
- **R:** Randomize hue offset for color variations
- **C:** Clear canvas
- **S:** Save current pattern as PNG
- **Close window:** Exit

## How It Works
- Rotational symmetry: mirrors your strokes radially around the center
- Reflection symmetry: mirrors across multiple axes
- Spiral symmetry: transforms points along a spiral

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- pygame
- numpy

## Run
```bash
python hypnotic_patterns/main.py
```

## Tips
- Move slowly for detailed, intricate patterns
- Fast sweeping motions create explosive, chaotic designs
- Combine different symmetry modes to discover new aesthetics
- Save your favorite patterns!
